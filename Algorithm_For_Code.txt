Algorithm of the Code:
Step 1: Enter into the predictor function and read data from csv file into a pandas dataFrame
Step 2: Create another column that tells the number of runs scored, including off the bat and extra runs conceded by the bowling team
Step 3: Now drop the columns 'run_off_bat' and 'extras' as they are not required anymore
Step 4: Only selectrows belonging to first 6 overs
Step 5: Preprocess the data so that we get a tuple of following kind in each row:('match_id','venue','innings','batting_team','bowling_team','total_runs')
Step 6: Convert back to the dataframe
Step 7: Read data from the unzipped folder
Step 8: Get data in a numpy array
Step 9: Get independent and target variables
Step 10: Split data in training and testing
Step 11: Fit a linear regressor
Step 12: Train the model
Step 13: Save the model and the supporting label encoders
Step 14: Read test data
Step 15: Encode venue and batting and bowling teams
Step 16: Make sure that the order of columns is same as that fed to the model
Step 17: Convert input test case into numpy array
Step 18: One hot encode venue, batting and bowling teams take as an numpy array
Step 19: Return the predicted score to main code
Step 20: Print the Output
